<h2>Twitter data gatekeeping</h2>
<p>Twitter data was already trendy, but the <em>unpresidented</em> 2016 U.S. election has elevated it to a fever pitch. One of the biggest drivers of the trend is the widespread, public availability of Twitter data. Twitter makes much of its user-generated data freely available to the public via Application Program Interfaces (APIs). APIs refer to sets of protocols and procedures for interacting with sites. Twitter maintains several APIs, but in the context of publicly available data collection two, in particular, stand out.</p>
<div id="twitters-rest-api" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Twitter’s REST API</h3>
<p>Twitter’s REST API provides a <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index">set of protocols</a> for exploring and interacting with Twitter data related to <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/intro-to-tweet-json">statuses (tweets)</a>, <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/overview">users</a>, and <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference">network connections (followers/friends)</a>. The data are RESTful in that they have been archived by Twitter. Navigating these resting endpoints can, at times, be <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/things-every-developer-should-know">resource intensive</a> and <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/rate-limits">slow</a>, but it also makes it possible to perform <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview/operator_descriptions">highly complex and specific queries</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="twitters-stream-api" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Twitter’s stream API</h3>
<p>Twitter data not yet archived and accessible via the REST API can be accessed using <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/guides/connecting">Twitter’s stream API</a>. As its name suggests, the stream API provides users with a live stream of Twitter data. Because the data are streamed, or pushed, to the user, the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/things-every-developer-should-know">stream API reduces overhead</a> associated with performing queries on archived data sources. This makes it possible to collect large amounts of data very quickly and with relatively little strain on computational resources. The downside to the stream API is that it is limited to prospective data collection via <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/sample-realtime/overview/GET_statuse_sample">sampling</a> or <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview">filtering</a>.</p>
